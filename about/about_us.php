            The All-Poland Women's Strike (Polish: Ogólnopolski Strajk Kobiet, OSK), is a women's rights social movement in Poland, established in September 2016. It was set up in protest against the rejection by the Sejm of the Polish Parliament of the bill "Save Women", which was considered by the Sejm in parallel to the project "Stop to Abortion". The movement was responsible for the organization of Black Monday, a protest action that took place simultaneously in 147 Polish cities, towns and villages.

            In October 2017, Marta Lempart was head of All-Poland Women's Strike. While OSK was a key organiser of the September 2016 Black Protests, the protests themselves were decentralised. The writer Klementyna Suchanow was one of OSK's leaders who proposed the 26 October "walk" to the house of de facto leader of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński, which turned into a 10,000-person protest. Suchanow described the tactics for the continuation of the protests as decentralised, up to grassroots initiatives and creativity.

            In October 2020, Suchanow stated that the OSK was not a political party, but that some members aimed at becoming members of the Sejm, and that Katarzyna Kotula of the OSK was already a Deputy.

        <p>
            On 1 November 2020, in response to the widespread demands of the October 2020 protests that extended beyond anger against an abortion-related ruling, OSK established the Consultative Council inspired by the Belarusian Coordination Council that had earlier been created in August 2020, during the 2020 Belarusian protests.
